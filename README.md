## (Re)naming of a project repository shared by multiple students (TODO students)
INSTRUCTIONS for naming the students' solution repository for assignments with several students, such as the final project. Students must use a 4-letter groupID, the same one that was chosed in the class spreadsheet: 
* Template: e4040-2021Fall-Project-GroupID-UNI1-UNI2-UNI3. -> Example: e4040-2021Fall-Project-MEME-zz9999-aa9999-aa0000.

# Organization of this directory
